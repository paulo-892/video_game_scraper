To update your CSV:
- Place the CSV in the first './vgscraper' directory, one level down from the Pipfile
- Launch the pipenv shell from the parent directory
- Update the CSV name to 'Video Games [Collection _ Completion]' or change the input file name in 'update_csv.py' and in the spider (in the spiders folder)
- Run 'scrapy crawl games' from the first './vgscraper' directory => this will update the 'prices_by_upc' file
- Run 'python update_csv.py' to update the CSV with the data from 'prices_by_upc'
- Insert the updated CSV into Google Drive
